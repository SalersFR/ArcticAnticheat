# Arctic Anticheat

### Overview

Arctic is an AntiCheat designed to block cheats on 1.7 and 1.8. It can block combat hacks, movement hacks, and many
others. Arctic uses ProtocolLib to listen to packets so the checks are run without affecting your server's performance.
High quality checks, high performance. A full list of blocked cheats can be found at the bottom of this page.

### Commands

`/arctic reload` - Relod configuration files.

`/arctic settings` - Configure many of the AntiCheat's setting through a GUI.

`/alerts [verbose]` - Toggle alerts (verbose optional).

`/info <player>` - Get information on a player such as their ping and version.

`/debug <check>` - Get important debug feedback for certain checks (mainly used for development).

### Dependencies

Since Arctic is packet based, you need to have ProtocolLib on your
server (https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/protocollib.1997/)

### A bit more

Arctic can detect every reach hacks that are > 3.1 with some time given.
